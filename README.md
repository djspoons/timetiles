# Timetiles

## FAQ

### Why did you make this?

Partly because I needed an excuse to relearn React/Redux and partly because I wanted to way to schedule some activies that I try to do every week, but not always on the same days.

### Why not just use a calendar?

I wanted something that wasn't as rigid as a calendar, and something that I could easily "reset" at the end of the week.

### Why can I only put three items in each day?

Can you really do more than three things in a day?

### Why does the week start with Sunday? What's with the Î£?

If you don't like the day labels you can just edit them in your browser's local storage.

### Something is messed up with the state.

Just remove the local storage and start again.

### How come it doesn't work across devices?

It just uses your browser's local storage.

### Why does it look different when it prints?

I thought it would be cool to just print the tiles and elide the labels, supply, and controls. (Make sure you enable background graphics to get the colors!)

### Does it work on mobile?

Probably not.
